After commuting  close to 1000kms a week for 6 years, I have decided to the the leap and move to Toronto. After all, I was here around 4 nights a week, and having to commute back and forward between Mississauga and Toronto had become a hassle. This would also increase my work drive (from 85kms each way to 115kms), but luckily my client agreed for me to work remote 4 days of the week, with made my move even more possible.

Seeing how I would be working from home most of the week, and how my office would be in the living room of our new place, I needed a space that not only was functional, but that could hold my three 27" monitors have have a clean look. I also wanted a standing desk because I can no longer get used to sitting the whole day.

After searching pinterest and online for ideas, I finally had a plan and knew what parts I would need.

And here's the final work:

The Wall
---

The space I had was perfect. The back wall has the length of 64", with 4 wood studs distributed evenly with 16" of space. The side wall had a stud 13" away from the corner, and another stud 16" away from it. I needed to leave space for the cabling since I did not want to bring it through the wall. Space was needed on the left for my NAS cables to go through, and in the middle for the cables coming down from the monitors, LEDs and keyboard and mouse.

The Monitor Mount
---

For the monitors I purchased the 3x [mounts](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00ZKFRKIU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) below on Amazon. I have the two main monitors mounted to a piece of plywood, which is in turn attached to the wall.

Support
---

I'm using 3x pieces of 2x4 over 4 wood studs, and an Ikea's [Gerton extendable leg](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/60261626/)

Table Top
---

The table is solid wood and also from Ikea - [GERTON Table top, beech](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/50106773/). It measures 61" L by 29" 1/2 W.

Because this is a stand-up desk, the top of table sits at 42" from the floor.

Lighting
---

I'm using the cheap 12v LEDs that you can buy anywhere.

For behind the monitors, I have cut the strips and I'm connecting them with also cheap LED connectors.

The table LEDs go through an aluminum channel.

Cabling
---

I'm using Ikea's [Signum Cable management](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/30200253/) under the desk and the [Uppleva Cord cover strip, white](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/80224893/) to hide the cables on the wall.

Controlling the Lighting
---

I'm using a custom bash script running on the background that checks if my monitors are on or off, and turns on the lights via curl commands to a Wemo Switch:

* [wemo_control.sh](https://gist.github.com/victorbrca/8520b815d055ebfba86904ebfd16b13c)
