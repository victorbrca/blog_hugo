So you need to configure pfSense with an UPS!? Well, good thing this post is called "**_How to Setup UPS on pfSense_**".

a. Start by plugging the USB cable to your pfSense and your UPS

b. Now log in to the pfSense UI and go into "System => Package Manager"

b. Search for 'nut' and click on 'Install'

c. Go to "Services => UPS => UPS Settings", select "Local USB", give the UPS a name and click on "Save"

d. Go back to the "UPS Status" page. If you can see your UPS then you are pretty much done. Now all you have to do is configure any additional NUT settings (if you need).

Possible Issues

### Troubleshooting 1

If your UPS is not showing in the "UPS Settings" page, logon to pfSense via ssh and issue `usbconfig`. You should be able to see your UPS listed.

```none
[2.4.4-RELEASE][admin@pfSense.localdomain] usbconfig
ugen0.1: <0x8086 XHCI root HUB> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=SUPER (5.0Gbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)
ugen1.1: <Intel EHCI root HUB> at usbus1, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=HIGH (480Mbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)
ugen0.2: <Smart Smart Wireless Device> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (100mA)
ugen1.2: <vendor 0x8087 product 0x8000> at usbus1, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=HIGH (480Mbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)
ugen0.3: <American Power Conversion Back-UPS ES 750G FW908.W3 .D USB FWW3> at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=LOW (1.5Mbps) pwr=ON (2mA)
```

#### Solution:

If you can't see your UPS with `upsconfig` try using another USB cable.

### Troubleshooting 2

If you can see the UPS with `usbconfig`, try to restart the service from command line so you can view error messages on stdout.

Browse to `/usr/local/etc/rc.d` and manually restart the NUT service with `./nut.sh restart`.

```none
[2.4.4-RELEASE][admin@pfSense.localdomain]/usr/local/etc/rc.d: ./nut.sh restart
