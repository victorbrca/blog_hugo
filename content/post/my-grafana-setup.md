For the past few weeks I have been working extensively on the devices in my LAN. My FreeNAS had crashed due to a power outage resulting on a burnt memory module and a data issue with my main pool that caused a kernel panic on boot. My remote backup solution had not been working for over a year, so I knew that it would also need a complete re-design.

I rebuilt my FreeNAS pools and setup a new remote backup solution using ZFS send (FreeNAS => Ubuntu 20.04), and got a couple of UPSs to protect from future power failures. I also created a better backup structure and jobs for my main devices (will post about that later), and configured additional alerts for device availability and job status. And to tie all down together, I thought what better than to revamp my Grafana dashboard to show all this new info.

Here's the final result! I'm quite happy with it.

How Everything is Placed Together
---

When I first started with Grafana, I was mainly using it with the Zabbix plugin and an imported [pfSense dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12023). I had one influx database that was used with pfSense, and a MariaDB for the imported Zabbix data. The dashboard gave me a basic overview of my network data usage (pfSense) as well as status for my LAN devices (Zabbix).

_**Old dashboard**_

With the new configuration things got a bit more complex (as expected). I'm now displaying data from 5 different servers, with 2 different OS types (FreeBSD and Linux) and 5 different distributions (pfSense, FreeNAS, Arch, CentOS and Ubuntu). My collector of choice is Telegraf (due to it's low resource and simplicity), and I have made an effort to stick to it throughout the different OSs in my design.

#### The Grafana Server

+ **OS:** CentOS 7
+ **Databases**:
    + InfluxDB
      + DB1 - pfsense
      + DB2 - Linux/FreeNAS
    + MariaDB
      + zabbix
+ **Plugins**:
  + Zabbix - [Zabbix plugin for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/alexanderzobnin-zabbix-app)
  + worldPing - [worldPing plugin for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/raintank-worldping-app)
  + Pie Chart - [Pie Chart plugin for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-piechart-panel)
  + Status Panel - [Status Panel plugin for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/vonage-status-panel)
+ **Imported Dashboards**:
  + [pfSense System Dashboard dashboard for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12023)
  + [Telegraf: system dashboard dashboard for Grafana \| Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/928)


#### Collectors

+ **CentOS** (also the Grafana server)
  + Zabbix => MariaDB
      + Collects LAN statistics
  + telegraf => InfluxDB (DB2)
      + Collects server resources
+ **pfSense**
  + telegraf => InfluxDB (DB1)
      + Collects server resources, network usage and UPS status
+ **Desktop (Arch)**
  + telegraf => InfluxDB (DB2)
      + Collects server resources and UPS status
+ **FreeNAS**
  + telegraf => InfluxDB (DB2)
      + Collects server resources and ZPOOL status/usage
+ **Ubuntu**
  + telegraf => InfluxDB (DB2)
      + Collects server resources, VPN status, IP address and ZPOOL status/usage

#### How it all looks together

As the proverb that says that "A pictures is worth a thousand words", if you are visual person like me the diagram below will help you have a better understanding of the setup I listed above.

Breaking it Down
---

Now let's dive a bit more into the current dashboard looking at what data is being displayed and from what data source.

I have divided the dashboard into 8 sections and labeled it with numbers (they may be small, but they are there).

Conclusion
---

While I'm happy with this setup there is still some room for improvement (as there always is). At some point I would like to consolidate the two Influx databases, integrate Unifi Controller and SmartThings data, and possibly add a Plex dashboard as well.

Got any comments or questions? Feel free to leave them in the comment section below.
