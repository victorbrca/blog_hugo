These instructions show you how to change the `config.json` file for a [Docker Mattermost Preview](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-preview/).


a- As root (or if you enabled non root users to manipulate docker), let's open a shell in the docker container

```
docker exec -ti mattermost-preview /bin/bash
```

b. Update the APT db on the docker instance and install `vim` (needed to edit the file)

```
apt update
apt install vim
```

c. Change `config_docker.json` as needed

```
cd /mm/mattermost/config

vim config_docker.json
```

d. Restart the docker container

```
docker restart mattermost-preview
```
