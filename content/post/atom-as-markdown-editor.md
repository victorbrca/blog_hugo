I have been looking for a good Markdown editor for quite a while, and after a lot of research, I finally I found one.

Some of the key features that were very important to me on a Markdown editor were:

- Live preview
- File browser (sidebar)
- GitHub flavored
- Fast and non laggy preview

And not surprisingly, [Atom](https://atom.io/) from GitHub was my solution.

You might also want to:

* Change the preferences of the already installed package [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) to GitHub flavored

* And install [markdown-preview-auto-open](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-auto-open)

```
apm install markdown-preview-auto-open
```
