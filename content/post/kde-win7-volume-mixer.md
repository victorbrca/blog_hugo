It's not often that we see Linux using something inspired by Microsoft, and this is one of those cases. If you are running KDE as your default DE, you should definitely take a look at "[Win7 Volume Mixer](https://store.kde.org/p/1100894/)" as an alternative to the default volume mixer. It adds a great visual and a more user friendly interface.

Here's a quick visual comparison:
